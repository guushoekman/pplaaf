			<h1>Who we are</h1>
			<p>Our team is led by human rights lawyer William Bourdon, founder of Sherpa and advocate of Edward Snowden, Antoine Deltour (LuxLeaks), Herve Falciani (SwissLeaks) and many other whistleblowers and politically oppressed individuals.</p>
			
			<p>PPLAAF aims to reduce the risks that whistleblowers commonly face by providing a highly secure system to enable encrypted, two-way communication with legal experts and investigators. We also provide advice, defense and in some cases legal representation for whistleblowers.</p>

			<p>All the while, we are pursuing the broader objectives of investigative journalism, public advocacy, legislation and coalition-building for change.</p>

			<p>We are ready to help whistleblowers who wish to report information on crime, corruption, illicit economic activity - whether in the public or private sector, as well as environmental risks that concern Africa. You may live or be based outside of Africa, and you do not need to be a citizen of an African country. As long as the information pertains to Africa, we are here to help.</p>
			
			<h3>Who we are not</h3>
			<p>We are not associated with any political, national or intelligence agenda nor are we funded by political, national or intelligence entities.</p>
