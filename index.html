            <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">PPLAAF aims to reduce the risks that whistleblowers commonly face by providing a highly secure system to enable encrypted, two-way communication with legal experts and investigators. We also provide advice, defense and in some cases legal representation for whistleblowers.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">All the while, we are pursuing the broader objectives of investigative journalism, public advocacy, legislation and coalition-building for change.</p>

            <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">We are ready to help whistleblowers who wish to report information on crime, corruption, illicit economic activity - whether in the public or private sector, as well as environmental risks that concern Africa. You may live or be based outside of Africa, and you do not need to be a citizen of an African country. As long as the information pertains to Africa, we are here to help.</p>

                <p>
                  Whistleblowers who contact us might be directed to a local and/or international lawyer who will explain the risks to which they are exposed, how they can safely report information on crime or corruption, which laws may protect them from reprisals, and other concerns. In case of legal proceedings, these lawyers can then defend the whistleblower. If this latter is indigent, PPLAAF will gather funding to insure legal representation. PPLAAF can also connect whistleblowers to NGOs to provide advocacy support. Our website is also a resource for information and analysis of whistleblower laws in African countries. This comprehensive resource will be updated on an ongoing basis by our legal experts and researchers.

                <p>
                  If the whistleblower and the lawyer agree that the information should be disclosed to the media, PPLAAF will assist in making contact with the most appropriate journalist and facilitate the information transfer. Partnerships between local and international journalists will be formed when necessary, on a case-by-case basis. If it is more appropriate to send the information to an NGO, PPLAAF will also facilitate these contacts to ensure the whistleblowerâ€™s safety and confidentiality.

            <p>Many leaking platforms exist configurated by NGOs or media to answer the question of how to transmit information safely. Their solutions limited to end-to-end encryption allow for safe transmission but is one that ultimately places the whistleblower in the care of the media for better or worse. PPLAAF provides the full spectrum of needs catered specifically to the whistleblower: at the micro or case-by-case level this includes end-to-end encryption for users, pro bono legal support relevant to advice or defense against employers or other entities; guidance as to how media or NGOs should be approached, and which media or NGOs should be approached; continued assistance on how best the whistleblower can be protected during media coverage. Similarly, for media partners, we provide a thorough vetting of the whistleblower and the leaks before referring onwards. At the macro level, PPLAAF conceptualises and helps to develop new or existing legislation around protected disclosures broadened to include non-employees, military and intel ombuds among other relevant aspects.</p>

            <h3>When do you need legal assistance?</h3>
            <p>You should consider obtaining legal advice or assistance, whoever you are, if you are considering reporting to authorities or releasing to the public inside information on criminal, scandalous or unsafe activities â€“ particularly if the information you have is confidential, classified, or an official or military secret.</p>
            <p>You may also need legal assistance or defense if you already have been privately or publicly identified as a whistleblower. Sharing sensitive information may violate sovereign or corporate laws or expose you to danger if not done with legal advice and a highly secure technology system.</p>
            <p>Please visit our page on the country case file, we might have done a preliminary research on your country.</p>
            <h3>What should you do if you need free legal assistance?</h3>
            <p>If you are considering or have already reported or disclosed sensitive information, contact us via the messaging service, online portal or hotline. We will connect you with the appropriate legal counsel at the local or international level, free of charge.</p>
            <h3>When do you need investigative, media or NGO assistance?</h3>
            <p>We recommend that you seek advice from our in-house team prior to contacting or sending information to the media or an NGO. We can advise whether this is the best route to take. In some cases, our teamâ€™s legal counsel can liaise on your behalf with a particular media outlet or advocacy organisation.</p>
            <p>Though the media or an NGO can be the best vehicle to report wrongdoing in the public interest, care must be taken in how to approach them and deciding which information to send. Our in-house editorial and advocacy teams can help you find the right journalist or NGO to contact.</p>
            <p>The information you want to disclose might not be enough to characterise the wrongdoing you want to expose. We can help you to assess that by deepening investigations.</p>
            <h3>What should you consider before disclosing any information to anyone?</h3>
            <p>Reporting or disclosing inside information, particularly if it is of a sensitive nature, can pose many risks to your job, profession, financial security, reputation and even your personal safety and the one of your family. We can help you assess and weigh these and other risks before you make a decision that could have serious unforeseen consequences.</p>
            <p>Acting in haste, many employees and citizens have reported crimes or acts of corruption without first seeking professional advice. We are here to help you avoid this mistake.</p>

          <div class="pitch-intro">
            <h1 class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Who is a whistleblower?</h1>
            <p>Whistleblowing is a term and a concept that carries different meanings around the world. At its basic level, it is when a citizen or employee exposes secretive acts of corruption, injustice, abuse of power or public health threats. The action or omission exposed by the whistleblower can be illegal, but it can also be immoral or against the general interest.</p>
            <p>What distinguishes whistleblowing from other kinds of reporting is that whistleblowers are in the position to suffer retaliation and reprisals, and that the inside information they have is critical in halting or preventing crimes, scandals and other threats to the public well-being.</p>
            <p>A whistleblower can beâ€¦</p>
            <p>...a bank employee who learns of a money laundering or tax evasion scheme within the bank and reports the operation to police or the public.</p>
            <p>â€¦a soldier who witnesses war crimes being committed by his fellow troops, films the atrocities and releases the video.</p>
            <p>â€¦a hospital worker who reports that doctors are selling treatments and medications that are supposed to be free.</p>
            <p>â€¦a public employee who discovers that a company has bribed a government official in order to win a public contract.</p>
            <p>We believe that the price of doing the right thing should not include sacrificing oneâ€™s life, freedom, family, income, job, career or health. In this capacity, PPLAAF plays the intermediary role by providing a community of in-house and external experts to ensure the the process of â€˜blowing the whistleâ€™ is removed of the perils and threats usually associated with the same.</p>
            <p>We are ready to help whistleblowers who wish to report information on crime, corruption, illicit economic activity - whether in the public or private sector, as well as environmental risks that concern Africa. You may live or be based outside of Africa, and you do not need to be a citizen of an African country. As long as the information pertains to Africa, we are here to help.</p>
