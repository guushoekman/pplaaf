    <h3>When do you need legal assistance?</h3>
    <p>You should consider obtaining legal advice or assistance, whoever you are, if you are considering reporting to authorities or releasing to the public inside information on criminal, scandalous or unsafe activities – particularly if the information you have is confidential, classified, or an official or military secret.</p>
    <p>You may also need legal assistance or defense if you already have been privately or publicly identified as a whistleblower. Sharing sensitive information may violate sovereign or corporate laws or expose you to danger if not done with legal advice and a highly secure technology system.</p>
    <p>Please visit our page on the country case file, we might have done a preliminary research on your country.</p>
    <h3>What should you do if you need free legal assistance?</h3>
    <p>If you are considering or have already reported or disclosed sensitive information, contact us via the messaging service, online portal or hotline. We will connect you with the appropriate legal counsel at the local or international level, free of charge.</p>
    <h3>When do you need investigative, media or NGO assistance?</h3>
    <p>We recommend that you seek advice from our in-house team prior to contacting or sending information to the media or an NGO. We can advise whether this is the best route to take. In some cases, our team’s legal counsel can liaise on your behalf with a particular media outlet or advocacy organisation.</p>
    <p>Though the media or an NGO can be the best vehicle to report wrongdoing in the public interest, care must be taken in how to approach them and deciding which information to send. Our in-house editorial and advocacy teams can help you find the right journalist or NGO to contact.</p>
    <p>The information you want to disclose might not be enough to characterise the wrongdoing you want to expose. We can help you to assess that by deepening investigations.</p>
    <h3>What should you consider before disclosing any information to anyone?</h3>
    <p>Reporting or disclosing inside information, particularly if it is of a sensitive nature, can pose many risks to your job, profession, financial security, reputation and even your personal safety and the one of your family. We can help you assess and weigh these and other risks before you make a decision that could have serious unforeseen consequences.</p>
    <p>Acting in haste, many employees and citizens have reported crimes or acts of corruption without first seeking professional advice. We are here to help you avoid this mistake.</p>
